1
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,786
You deserve this...

2
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,706
You do.

3
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,375
You've earned it.

4
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,792
I can do all things. All things.

5
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,603
Come on...

6
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,190
Come on, come on...

7
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,935
I am the Invigilator.

8
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,145
Listen carefully to
every word I say.

9
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:38,232
There will be no repetition.

10
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,528
I won't apologise for the hardships
you've endured reaching this room

11
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,323
'cause the pressures and
pains were necessary.

12
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,535
Resilience is a key attribute
in these dark times,

13
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:54,414
and if you can't survive our selection
process, you won't survive in the job.

14
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:58,585
Many highly-qualified candidates
tried to get this far and failed.

15
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,588
You have succeeded.

16
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,966
And now the final stage
lies before you.

17
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,845
One last hurdle separates
you from your goal

18
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,472
which is to join our
esteemed ranks.

19
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,642
The test is simple in comparison,
yet it will determine

20
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,312
who leaves this room with
a contract of employment

21
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,567
and who leaves with
the bus fare home.

22
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,280
Through these trials, you've
gained some idea of the power

23
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,324
of this organisation, so
believe me when I tell you

24
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,537
that there's no law in
this room but our law.

25
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:38,125
And the only rules in
here are our rules.

26
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,131
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

27
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,384
If you try to
communicate with myself

28
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,471
or the guard, you
will be disqualified.

29
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:56,310
If you spoil your paper,
intentionally or accidentally,

30
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,687
you will be disqualified.

31
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,733
If you choose to leave
the room for any reason,

32
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,027
you will be disqualified.

33
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,739
Any questions?

34
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,745
Best of luck, ladies
and gentlemen.

35
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,584
We're giving the eight
of you 80 minutes.

36
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:27,424
80 minutes to convince us you
have what it takes to join us.

37
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:32,137
80 minutes to determine the
next 80 years of your lives.

38
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,433
Begin.

39
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,089
I'm not finished.

40
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,886
No, please. You can't!
This isn't a proper test!

41
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,515
Please, I'll start over!
Just give me a chance!

42
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,684
Hey...

43
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,769
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

44
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,944
It's not about what
he said, you know.

45
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,822
It's what he didn't say.

46
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,496
"If you attempt to
communicate..."

47
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,248
...with myself or the guard...

48
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,709
...you will be disqualified.

49
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,550
- He didn't say... We
can't speak to each other.

50
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:46,099
- Now you're talking. - Is this
the ultimate mind-fuck or what?

51
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,195
- Has anyone figured
out the answer? - No.

52
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,822
It's not about the answer.
It's about the question.

53
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:05,202
- What's the question? - We've got
74 minutes left to figure out.

54
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,955
If the answer
takes one minute to write down.

55
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,873
If it takes 73 minutes to write,

56
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,418
we have one minute to
guess the question.

57
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,047
We're short on writing space.
I'm betting it's the former.

58
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,758
We've gotta help each other.

59
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,929
We're in competition. Why
should I help you to beat me?

60
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:27,599
We may be in competition
to answer the question,

61
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,395
but to establish the question
we have to cooperate.

62
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,605
They expect us to
cooperate, don't they?

63
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:36,191
What'd you expect, you're
gonna win this job,

64
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,862
with all the rewards
that come with it,

65
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,656
by giving them a little
simple written answer?

66
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,659
- Facts and opinions?
- Compare and contrast

67
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,579
They're not looking for that.

68
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,583
A job like this
needs initiative,

69
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,751
observation...

70
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,881
...interplay.

71
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:04,303
- Teamwork. He's right.
- We're in a stress scenario.

72
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,931
A confusing,
time-critical situation

73
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:11,977
designed to test our
intelligence, and resilience.

74
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,772
- To bring out the worst in us.
- Or the best.

75
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,235
We help each other until
the playing field is open

76
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:24,114
then it's every man for
themselves - no of fence, girls.

77
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,786
- Are we all agreed?
- Yes.

78
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,664
Agreed.

79
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:41,465
- Let's go, Gandhi. - My name
isn't Gandhi, friend. It's...

80
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:46,261
No names. Not real ones, anyway. They're
not written on this for a reason.

81
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,139
We'll use nicknames, then.

82
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:55,771
- All right, let's make this
easy. - We already have numbers.

83
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:57,898
Yeah, and visual.

84
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,821
You're Black.

85
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,283
I'm White.

86
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,661
You're Brown.

87
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,498
We've got Blonde here,

88
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,292
Brunette there...

89
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,047
...Dark, I suppose.

90
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,969
And last as well as
least we've got Deaf.

91
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:38,188
- Tough last round.
- Yeah, whatever.

92
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,734
Any objections?

93
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,864
Apart from your grossly insensitive
sexual and racial stereotyping?

94
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,658
If you're the sensitive type,
you shouldn't be here, love.

95
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,077
I'll take Brown over Gandhi,

96
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:55,831
we're talking about
something that matters.

97
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,709
I'll take that as a yes.

98
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:13,432
So, what else hasn't
he forbidden?

99
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,856
He hasn't forbidden
us to stand, has he?

100
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,766
- Well, I guess moving about is Ok
too. - What's that gonna achieve?

101
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,478
I don't know, Brown. But sitting
wasn't getting us anywhere exciting.

102
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:03,732
What if the question is written
down but we just can't see it?

103
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,068
That's what I'm talking about!

104
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:09,905
- You mean like invisible ink?
- Or a watermark.

105
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,534
- It's possible. - It's probable.
- Where else would it be?

106
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,121
We'd need something
to reveal it. Like light.

107
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:30,926
- Right.
- Those are halogen.

108
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:34,012
Those aren't.

109
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:39,518
They won't bite, you know.

110
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,531
They're not gonna make
it that easy, are they?

111
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,993
We're on the clock. How hard
can they afford to make it?

112
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:03,709
What if the pencil isn't
just for writing the answer?

113
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:08,589
What if it reveals the question too? By
shading the page, like tracing paper?

114
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,844
- Try it, Blonde.
- No. Remember what he said.

115
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,639
If you spoil your paper,
intentionally or accidentally...

116
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,601
...you'll be disqualified.

117
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:26,648
Is anyone certain they know what
his definition of spoiling is?

118
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,235
Look, let's crack this.
Throw out some ideas.

119
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:33,572
What if the questions are
hidden in the paper,

120
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,493
but each of us has to write a
different answer? He said...

121
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:41,580
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

122
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,791
That doesn't mean it's the
same question for each of us.

123
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,836
There could be eight different
questions and answers.

124
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,423
If we find one question,
we can find them all.

125
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,052
Not necessarily. Not if our
eight individual questions

126
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,430
can only be revealed using
eight different methods.

127
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,557
Perhaps we're not meant
to cooperate at all.

128
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,226
I like that idea.

129
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,437
Or there's only one question,
printed on only one of our sheets.

130
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,441
- Then we'd need to cooperate...
- Time-out for some testing.

131
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:14,863
- Everyone up to the light.
- I said it won't be that easy.

132
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,075
Unless you want to make a list
of our brainwaves, White,

133
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:20,953
I say we cross a
few off as we go.

134
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,748
Fine.

135
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,402
Allow me.

136
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:04,371
Thank you.

137
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,630
Yeah, join in any time, Deaf

138
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,266
Not one for small talk, are you?

139
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:25,976
Come.

140
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,606
Relax, you'll get it back

141
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:45,412
Like I said, I think we can
strike light off the list.

142
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,045
Light is a spectrum.

143
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,339
There's light we can see,

144
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,050
but there's light we can't see.

145
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:01,303
Like ultraviolet,
infra-red, X-rays.

146
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,264
If we can't see it, how are
we supposed to find it?

147
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,143
The source must be visible,
even if the light isn't. Right?

148
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,132
Find the light switches.

149
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,853
There aren't any, not
in here anyway. And...

150
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,689
If you choose to leave the
room for any reason...

151
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,232
...we'll be disqualified.

152
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,028
There must be some way
to trigger these.

153
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,826
This is emergency lighting.

154
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,203
So let's create an emergency.

155
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:12,166
That would be very risky.

156
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,627
- It's less risky than doing
nothing. - He's right.

157
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:20,924
If we try this and fail, we
can't go back. Blackout.

158
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,724
We vote.

159
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,882
Those too.

160
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:34,206
Nice! Very nice!

161
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,458
Touch of blue, what you wanted?

162
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,502
This is black light.

163
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,172
The kind credit card firms use to
reveal their security symbols.

164
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,685
Shame we didn't apply
to work for Visa

165
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,730
- Our gamble might have paid off.
- it did pay off.

166
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:02,317
Just not in the way you wanted.

167
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,821
You acted, and the room reacted.

168
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:10,409
We've entered a dialogue
now, we should keep going.

169
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:13,620
Yeah, maybe... Maybe not.

170
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:20,294
Sorry, it was invisible
light you said you wanted.

171
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,796
This looks pretty
fucking visible to me.

172
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:27,050
Scientific term for it
is "near-ultraviolet".

173
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,137
It didn't work, but
it was worth trying.

174
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,601
If nothing else we'll come
out of this with great tans.

175
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,063
We've got to knock
these out too.

176
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,693
The top halves of these
strips aren't lit.

177
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,155
Look.

178
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,599
Infrared. The other option.

179
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:19,853
- That exposes something too? -
It's less common than UV, but yes.

180
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,649
Art historians use it
to make reflectograms

181
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,735
of the sketch outlines
beneath paintings.

182
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,405
If there's a hidden
layer in our papers...

183
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:40,666
Carefully.

184
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,112
Let me guess, "near-infrared"?

185
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,574
All right, everyone, try again.

186
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:27,087
- Anyone? Anything?
- No.

187
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,549
Shit!

188
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,848
- Now can we get off the lighting? - If
you can provide a better alternative.

189
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:41,476
Any alternative. We've burned a
quarter of our time already.

190
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:47,482
Perhaps they company's Japanese-owned
and this is an origami exam.

191
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,277
Be our guest. That sheet
is yours to spoil.

192
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,620
Yes, it is, but only your sheet.

193
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,925
- It's a piece of paper.
- No, it's more than that now.

194
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:16,303
This is experimental material.

195
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,847
- If you spoil...
- ..Your paper.

196
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:22,935
- Your paper! ..You
will be disqualified.

197
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,770
This isn't mine. This is hers.

198
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,439
"It's not fair"

199
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:30,692
And she's gone. So...

200
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:37,616
Tracing...

201
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,714
Well, congratulations, Blonde.
Your idea sucks too.

202
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:55,634
This could all be a
distraction, you know.

203
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,845
We could be missing
something obvious.

204
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All right!

205
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:05,602
Light does not work,
lead does not work...

206
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:08,856
Liquid!

207
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,151
Oh, yeah...

208
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,368
Right.

209
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:24,246
Lick it, spit on it, get it wet.

210
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,041
If the question's watermarked we
need some liquid to bring it out.

211
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,003
- What are you doing with yours?
- You don't wanna know.

212
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,006
- Actually, we do.
- Well, you can come and watch.

213
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,425
You can hold it for
me too if you like.

214
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:40,637
- Though I'd prefer it if Blonde did.
- That's disgusting.

215
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,765
"By any means necessary",
right, brother?

216
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:46,226
If we can do it, we should.

217
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:50,606
That's not gonna burn the question out.
Urine's sterile. You can drink it...

218
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:55,569
- Wish you would.
- Great. A pissing contest.

219
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,329
Anything?

220
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:11,293
- I can't tell yet. It's all yellow.
- Hold it up and let us see.

221
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,670
If you'll lend me a
glove, I'll oblige.

222
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,090
Well, I'm running out of ideas.

223
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,060
Giving up so easily, Black,
with 57 minutes on the clock?

224
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,770
You know what...

225
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:33,649
Will you two shut up? Some
of us are trying to think!

226
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:48,330
At last, he speaks.

227
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:58,131
He's French.

228
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:02,094
- Vous voyez la?
- Does anyone here speak French?

229
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,012
Vous voyez la?

230
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,851
Can you see?

231
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,937
Vous voyez...?

232
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,901
Regardez bien.

233
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:23,198
- Can you see it in there?
- See what in there?

234
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:27,327
See what? Pretty colours?

235
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:30,998
- Vous-meme.
- Yourself.

236
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,168
Vous vous voyez.

237
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:39,006
It shows you yourself.

238
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:47,681
- And then there was six. - Leave
him alone. He's done nothing.

239
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,226
He's done nothing for me
either or any of us. Nutter!

240
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,608
Toujours y voir clairement
est primordial.

241
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,359
To see clearly is all.

242
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,571
All right, that's enough
out of you, Sartre!

243
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,993
Fucking philosophers.

244
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,166
Thank God this world belongs to
the doers, not the thinkers.

245
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:19,338
Since we're proposing grand theories,
let me advance one of my own.

246
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,510
This is not an exam.

247
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,055
Not in the conventional
sense anyway.

248
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,807
Look around.

249
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,519
You couldn't ask for a
more representative group

250
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,563
to qualify for the final stage.

251
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,067
Four men and four women
entered this room,

252
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:43,278
all from differing cultures
and ethnic backgrounds,

253
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,532
possessing a healthy
mixture of skill-sets.

254
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:50,285
How convenient that is.
How staged.

255
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:55,499
What are you saying? They rigged
the tests to bring us together?

256
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:58,460
Some kind of experiment
in group dynamics.

257
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:03,340
- What are you on about?
- I'm saying this is a game.

258
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:07,261
- And they're betting on us.
- Right and who is "they"?

259
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,556
The board.

260
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,814
I guess they're
watching us right now.

261
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,696
They'll be ex-VCs mostly.

262
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:28,448
Probably left the incubator
when they realised

263
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,618
their little start-up had
struck the motherlode.

264
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,621
It wouldn't get any sweeter
than this, I'm sure.

265
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:37,916
So they joined the board,

266
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:40,252
secured some big
fat stock options

267
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:44,047
and bought themselves the
right to have a little fun...

268
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,258
With us.

269
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:49,428
Don't they have better things
to do with their time?

270
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:54,308
Like what?

271
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,728
At their level, money ceases
to be the prime motivator.

272
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,980
It's risk they live for.

273
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,441
They're type A's, like us,

274
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,903
and just as they were trained
by their investment companies,

275
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,114
they're still betting
on ideas today.

276
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,826
Ours.

277
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:17,539
Who'll decipher the question,
who'll come up empty and fold

278
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:21,251
and who'll crack under pressure?

279
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,631
You could be wrong.

280
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,634
It could just be the
Invigilator behind there.

281
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,470
Wanna bet?

282
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,806
I wouldn't, if I were you.

283
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:38,352
Brown talks like a gambler
because he is one.

284
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,688
A professional. Aren't you?

285
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:47,945
And you, Dark, are a shrink.

286
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:57,287
Psychologist or psychiatrist?
I forget the difference.

287
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,873
Psychiatrists dispense
drugs to control mood.

288
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,501
I'm a qualified student
of human behaviour.

289
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:05,420
Then you should know
what I'm talking about.

290
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:10,676
The point of having power is to
exercise it in all its forms.

291
00:34:10,843 --> 00:34:14,429
- We're pawns of the Gods in here.
- So? This changes nothing!

292
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,973
Yeah...

293
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,935
Games are played to be won...
as a team.

294
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:22,479
Yeah, or as individuals.

295
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:25,941
Not if the only way for them
to win is for us to lose.

296
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:29,194
All of us. Have you
thought about that?

297
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,782
You're wrong.

298
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,410
There is no 'them' watching us.

299
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,538
The CEO is hands-on.

300
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:43,292
He micro-manages anything of
importance to his company.

301
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:47,171
And this is no ordinary
selection process.

302
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,382
We're special.

303
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:54,803
If anyone's back there besides
the invigilator, it's him.

304
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:59,266
Everyone else is a secretary in his
structure - even board members.

305
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,519
That's how he likes it.

306
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,315
How do you know all this?

307
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,442
We're wasting time.

308
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:11,487
There's 50 minutes left, we're no
closer to finding the question.

309
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,699
Somehow I suspect my question
relates to the question.

310
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,702
So answer me.

311
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:23,707
- How did you learn that information? -
Same way you learned about the board.

312
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,669
I don't know anything about the
board. I made an educated guess.

313
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:31,673
But you... you know who the CEO
is and what he's like. How come?

314
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,719
- How come you don't? - How
could we? We were headhunted.

315
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:40,641
- Why? Weren't you?
- Of course not!

316
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:45,604
I heard there was a vacancy and
applied. I thought we all did!

317
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,441
Are you saying you wanna
work for this company,

318
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:54,780
jumped through every hoop to get here
but you don't know who they are?

319
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:59,201
They listed salary and benefits.
The job description detailed,

320
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:02,663
"A high level of responsibility
in a Fortune 500 company

321
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:08,043
manufacturing state-of-the-art technology
in a core service industry". All right?

322
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,964
- You didn't wanna know anymore? -
The deal was no questions asked.

323
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,300
Anyone would've done the
same in our position...

324
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,886
Anyone with... balls.

325
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,892
- You all applied?
- Yeah.

326
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:28,981
If this job is so prestigious,
why they need to advertise?

327
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:32,067
- They didn't.
- We have our sources.

328
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:36,155
- Looks like we're outnumbered.
- I wouldn't cry about it.

329
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:38,991
- You've the edge over us now.
- How's that?

330
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:42,286
You're wanted, aren't you?
They invited you to apply.

331
00:36:44,163 --> 00:36:48,167
I'd say we're disadvantaged because
you showed the initiative to apply.

332
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,419
We're behind the curve now.

333
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:56,550
So tell us what you know, starting
with a complete job description.

334
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:59,928
- We don't have that information.
- Should we believe that?

335
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,472
We don't know any more about the job.

336
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,350
We just know about the
company and, believe me,

337
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:09,271
the worst job with them beats
the best anyone else can offer.

338
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:14,568
He's right. Who they are, who the
CEO is and what he's achieved,

339
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,029
that's all you need to know.

340
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:18,989
All right, so tell us about it.

341
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,912
I'll give you a clue.

342
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,582
10 years ago a lot of healthy
young people around the world

343
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,251
got sick and started dying.

344
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,170
You may have read about that.

345
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:37,674
Then a medical researcher
patented a virus suppressant.

346
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,594
The mortality rate
halved in six months,

347
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,347
and now his company
is the biggest player

348
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:47,059
in the global health industry
with a turnover of $20 billion

349
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:50,687
and a market capitalisation
of $60 billion.

350
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,272
If it was a nation state,

351
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:55,943
it would rank as the world's
eighth largest economy.

352
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,237
Next year that rises to sixth.

353
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,240
You may have read
about that too.

354
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,327
Biorg!

355
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:07,162
80 minutes...

356
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:10,249
...to determine the next
80 years of your lives.

357
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:11,750
Remember?

358
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,461
Longevity is what they do.

359
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:20,384
Antisense drugs, gene therapy,
microsurgical applications.

360
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,179
They announced a hiring freeze
last year! Everyone knows that.

361
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:30,561
Publicly that's true. Privately...
they're expanding again.

362
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,940
Gearing up for a big
push of some kind.

363
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,319
They've found a cure.

364
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,738
They must have!

365
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,783
Manufacturing and marketing

366
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:48,579
would triple in size
for the roll-out.

367
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:53,125
There'd be jobs for all of us!

368
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:57,296
- We don't know that.
- But it's possible, isn't it?

369
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:02,718
How long would FDA approval
take, if it's true?

370
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:06,513
- That's not my field.
- Hold on.

371
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,475
Why are you so interested?
Something you want to tell us?

372
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:14,313
If you're asking "Am I infected?",
White, the answer is "No".

373
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:18,609
- I'm clean.
- But someone you know isn't.

374
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:22,488
We all know someone with the virus,
that's why they call it a pandemic.

375
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:27,326
Nice evasive manoeuvre, but we're talking
about the real reason you're here.

376
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,663
Yeah... So, what
relative is it?

377
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,585
Is it your mum? Your Dad?
Little sister...

378
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,546
It's my partner, Ok? He
can't afford suppressants,

379
00:39:39,713 --> 00:39:43,091
but they're discounted to
employees - are you happy now?

380
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,721
So who else is a
charity case here?

381
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,936
Yeah, you wouldn't
speak up, if you were.

382
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:57,856
Don't want to commit career suicide
on camera like she just has.

383
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,067
With a little help from you.

384
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,736
I didn't create her
situation, I just exposed it.

385
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:07,699
Doesn't matter. If she gets
the answer right, she's still hired.

386
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:11,036
Really? Says who?
What... them?

387
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:18,168
- If memory serves me correct... - The
only rules in here are our rules.

388
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,255
They can disqualify everyone!

389
00:40:21,421 --> 00:40:24,925
They can do whatever they like and
we can't do a thing about it.

390
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,177
So... congratulations!

391
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:30,681
You've just disqualified yourself
without breaking any rules.

392
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:34,518
He won't kick you out, but
you're dead in the water, honey.

393
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,146
Dead in the water.

394
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,692
Don't listen to him. We'll
get through this together.

395
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:44,236
Thanks, but I don't
need your help,

396
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:48,824
because my situation isn't a
weakness, it's a strength.

397
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,329
I'm sure they're smart
enough to realise that.

398
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,749
And if I could talk to the CEO

399
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:02,087
I'd assure him the treatment my partner
needs will only deepen my commitment

400
00:41:02,254 --> 00:41:05,716
to his organisation
for years to come.

401
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,805
You really think
he's behind there?

402
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,725
He's lived behind
walls for years.

403
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:18,854
No one outside his inner circle
has even seen him since the lPO.

404
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,900
If he wanted to
hire an assistant,

405
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,611
this is the way he'd do it.

406
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:42,127
What are you doing?

407
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,756
Proving my worth. You may have
run out of ideas, but I haven't.

408
00:41:45,923 --> 00:41:50,594
- Don't even try talking to him.
- I'm not gonna talk to him.

409
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:03,565
Is there anything in there,
or is he happy to see you?

410
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:30,050
What have we here?

411
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:35,806
Is that all?

412
00:42:40,686 --> 00:42:42,062
Heat may have an effect

413
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:44,982
if the papers have been
chemically treated.

414
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:49,903
- If we warmed them from beneath... -
It's not heat and chemicals, Black.

415
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,407
It's just chemicals.

416
00:42:56,535 --> 00:43:00,164
What are you talking about? H2O?

417
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:05,043
We already tried H2O! It's
in all our bodily fluids!

418
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,340
What are these pipes connected to? You
could pump any liquid through them!

419
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:17,389
Come on, Einstein.

420
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:20,726
Good Lord, you're right.

421
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:28,108
These aren't infrared at all.

422
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,778
They're safelights! Common
standard-issue safelights!

423
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:35,532
We're in a darkroom! This
room is a great big darkroom!

424
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:40,037
- And this must be photographic
paper. - Meaning we can develop it?

425
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:44,291
You hope... Developing photos
isn't a one-stage process.

426
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:48,545
- It takes chemical baths, fixing
agents... - For colour photography.

427
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,131
To pull black letters
from a white background

428
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,091
all you need is
developing fluid.

429
00:43:57,387 --> 00:43:58,931
Let's do this.

430
00:44:04,353 --> 00:44:06,271
I'm in.

431
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,987
Even if she's right,
isn't a chemical shower a bad idea?

432
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,074
It'll be diluted. They
wouldn't hire damaged goods.

433
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,244
But covering your eyes,
nose and mouth may be wise.

434
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:24,206
They're not the
only things worth covering.

435
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,922
That's it: Join in at last.

436
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,258
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

437
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:13,380
No worries, love. Let me.

438
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,727
Let's go.

439
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:01,470
- Well?
- It'll take a few moments.

440
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,020
Where's my paper?

441
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,694
Has anyone seen my paper?

442
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:17,296
No!

443
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:27,681
You bastard! Bastard!

444
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:32,060
How could you? How could you?
Bastard!

445
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,721
What did you just do?

446
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:12,809
What I had to.

447
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:15,312
I should punch your lights out!

448
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:22,903
- Black, what did you do?
- it's not what he did.

449
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,864
- it's what he said.
- What?

450
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:29,493
"Lights out".
So... lights up!

451
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,963
- That's better.
- Lights out.

452
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:46,468
Lights up. Voice-activated.

453
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:52,182
- They're playing with us.
- Great, isn't it?

454
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:57,020
- Everybody watch what you say.
- And do.

455
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,518
Up one minute, down the next.

456
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,402
Can't write on this anymore,
can you? Go on, try.

457
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:51,200
Don't then.

458
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,917
Are you hungry, mate?
Oi, are you hungry?

459
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,795
I am. I'm really hungry.

460
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:07,090
There's no snack machines
in here, though, are there?

461
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:13,013
Go on, rip it up...
Oi! Rip it up!

462
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:18,310
- Hey! What did I tell you before?
- She said leave him alone, White.

463
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:28,529
- Tear it up!
- White, will you stop!

464
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,366
Tear it up! Tear it!

465
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:38,372
I won't tell you again, White!

466
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:42,417
That's it, good boy. Go on.

467
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:46,922
Go on. More, more.

468
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:50,008
Put it in your mouth.

469
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:11,738
S'il vous plait!

470
00:51:21,748 --> 00:51:24,459
And then there were five.

471
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:32,926
"Bastard" doesn't do you justice.

472
00:51:34,136 --> 00:51:36,889
You said we should cooperate until
we discovered the question!

473
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,099
So I lied!

474
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:42,352
I lied. So what?

475
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:45,522
Lying is not against
the rules, is it?

476
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:52,779
Anyway, you don't have to listen
to me, let alone agree or obey.

477
00:51:52,946 --> 00:51:57,367
You should thank me. All
of you should thank me.

478
00:51:57,534 --> 00:52:01,288
I've just narrowed down the
field, so your odds improve.

479
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:04,416
Odds mean nothing without the
question in front of us!

480
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:07,753
You can forget about any more
help from us in finding it.

481
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,340
I don't need your help. You'll
find it's you who needs my help.

482
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:14,134
You know why? 'Cause
I figured it out.

483
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:16,470
Oh, really? The question?
What is it, then?

484
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,347
Why should I?

485
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,768
Because if you don't,
I'll beat it out of you.

486
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:29,983
You're full of shit, White.
You have been from the start.

487
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,236
You don't know anything.

488
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:35,739
He wouldn't tell us if he did,
'cause he's a narcissist.

489
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:38,408
He despises us.

490
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:41,203
Sticks and stones, love.

491
00:52:42,371 --> 00:52:44,790
I bet you say that
to all the boys.

492
00:52:44,957 --> 00:52:47,584
Only the ones with Narcissistic
Personality Disorder.

493
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,004
There are nine character
traits to look for.

494
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:54,758
Arrogance, grandiosity, a
belief in one's uniqueness,

495
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:57,386
a preoccupation with
power and success,

496
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,889
an excessive need to be admired,
a sense of entitlement,

497
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:05,269
lack of empathy and the twin
tendencies to envy and exploit others.

498
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:09,106
For clinical diagnosis, a patient
must exhibit five of these.

499
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:13,152
- You tick enough boxes. - You
can add a tenth to that list.

500
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:17,823
"A tendency to see through all the bullshit
surrounding you, and rise above it."

501
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,869
- I'll tick that box myself.
- Let me tick it for you.

502
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,759
- That was smart.
- That was necessary.

503
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:40,304
We may need him.
He's a resource.

504
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,015
You don't like someone?
Outwit them.

505
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,851
He's an enemy of the
group, and a distraction!

506
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:57,779
Are you gonna give me a hand?

507
00:54:05,454 --> 00:54:07,915
One, two...

508
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:19,718
What are you doing?

509
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:24,806
Ensuring that he can't 'cause any
more trouble when he wakes up.

510
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:28,310
- And taking him out of the
game. - That hardly seems fair.

511
00:54:28,477 --> 00:54:32,105
He's sacrificed his right to
fair treatment. Forward a bit.

512
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:45,953
See? I put him down and suddenly
we're cooperating again.

513
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,803
He's a talker.

514
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,644
We could go further than this.

515
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:14,314
She's right.

516
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:18,902
We could carry him to the
door and slide him out.

517
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:24,950
He ejected two of us: Why
shouldn't we eject him?

518
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:30,122
- Call it justice, or Karma if you prefer.
- You don't believe in forgiveness?

519
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:34,459
- I'll forgive him afterwards. -
And your gospel of cooperation?

520
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:40,424
I'll tolerate anyone,
except the intolerant.

521
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,554
Those in favour...

522
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,769
Fifty-fifty.

523
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:54,938
To each his own.

524
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:04,364
If you won't think selflessly
about this, think selfishly.

525
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,283
The Invigilator said...

526
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:09,453
If you choose to leave
this room for any reason,

527
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,622
you'll be disqualified.

528
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:15,417
He's not choosing to leave, is
he? You're choosing for him.

529
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:20,714
Which puts you at risk too.

530
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:48,200
Go on, White, spoil yourself.
It's your turn.

531
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:51,703
Make your Mark.

532
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:02,631
Look, we have less than half an hour left
and we still don't know the question.

533
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,844
He claims to know the question.

534
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:20,816
Shut up!

535
00:57:34,538 --> 00:57:36,915
I need medication,
it's in my pocket.

536
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:41,628
- What kind of medication?
- What does it matter?

537
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:45,507
A pill, all right? I need to
take it every hour, on the hour.

538
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:49,094
- That's right now.
- Every hour, on the hour?

539
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:52,347
Only one condition
is treated that way.

540
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,020
You're infected too, aren't you?

541
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:05,527
That's more than justice.
That's poetic justice.

542
00:58:05,694 --> 00:58:09,364
If you don't believe me, untie
my arms, so I can take the pill!

543
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,993
- Go on!
- Nice try.

544
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,121
It's pathetic, actually.

545
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:21,210
Take it yourself. Get it for me
yourself. It's in my left pocket!

546
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:25,714
- I'll do what you want.
- Just do it. - Really?

547
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,800
Tell us what the
question is then.

548
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,346
All right, get the pill
and I'll tell you.

549
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:34,723
Come on! Fucking do it!

550
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:38,685
Go on, it's my left pocket.

551
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:41,230
Go on, try again, it's in there.
Go on.

552
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,567
Where the fuck is it?

553
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:49,029
One of you has taken it! One
of you has fucking taken it!

554
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:54,326
This isn't funny! You know what happens
when you don't take suppressants!

555
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:59,456
Unconsciousness. Convulsions.
Shock. Coma. Then death.

556
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,251
We know exactly what happens

557
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:05,128
and the process takes
hours, not minutes.

558
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:14,263
Listen, mate, I'll be
out of this for good!

559
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:16,139
A taste of your own medicine.

560
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:23,522
- Don't do it, don't do it.
- Look on the bright side, brother

561
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:28,026
If you start to convulse, we'll
know you're telling the truth.

562
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:30,946
Then we'll gladly help you.

563
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:41,456
Looks like you've got your wish.

564
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:47,421
For now.

565
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:50,757
He had to be dealt with
one way or another.

566
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:54,052
I wouldn't be surprised if
he was a plant all along.

567
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:58,473
It's the kind of thing they'd do
to stir up our internal dynamics.

568
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,767
To set us against one another.

569
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:04,480
If so, we've seized
back the initiative.

570
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:07,483
Or you have.

571
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:11,737
He isn't smart enough
to be a plant.

572
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:17,034
But you on the other hand.

573
01:00:17,201 --> 01:00:19,286
You think she's one of them?

574
01:00:19,453 --> 01:00:22,122
Don't be absurd! I told
you I'm a psychologist!

575
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:26,960
You claimed to be a qualified student
of psychology, not a practitioner.

576
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:33,509
I've studied psychology too,
and reverse psychology.

577
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:36,720
What better way to hide your
true role in this farce

578
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:39,848
than to accuse another candidate
of playing your part?

579
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,975
I don't know what
you're talking about.

580
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:45,062
Amateur psychology is a
useful tool for gamblers,

581
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:48,023
but a degree in the subject

582
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:54,154
sounds like the perfect foundation for
a career in, say human resources.

583
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,866
You're on the wrong
side of the glass.

584
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:01,411
- He's the one who manipulated...
- Maybe you work as a team.

585
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:04,373
He's got the mouth, but you...

586
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:08,460
...know an awful lot about
Biorg Pharmaceuticals.

587
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:11,547
- I told you I applied!
- So did we.

588
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:14,508
- And I do my research!
- So did we!

589
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:19,471
Any of us could be plants,
but not all of us.

590
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:23,058
At least one candidate has to be
genuine for the test to be viable.

591
01:01:23,225 --> 01:01:25,060
- That would be me.
- And me.

592
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:29,356
My point is we can't prove
anyone's guilt or innocence,

593
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,400
so it's a waste of time to try.

594
01:01:31,567 --> 01:01:34,278
If we can't maintain trust and
cooperation, we're through.

595
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:36,864
Trust has to be earned, sister.

596
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,450
We never had 'cause to trust
each other in the first place.

597
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:45,330
Trust is a choice. We can choose
to keep cooperating, if necessary.

598
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,458
- I think it's necessary.
- We have no other option.

599
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,627
Trust makes me nervous.

600
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:57,593
- I prefer proof.
- What are you doing?

601
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,179
- Get off me!
- Are you insane?

602
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:04,975
- Brown, why are you doing this?
- Because I like winning!

603
01:02:11,398 --> 01:02:13,775
Now tell us the truth, Dark.

604
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:17,279
Please... You said we've
to trust each other!

605
01:02:17,446 --> 01:02:20,741
Now you're gonna stand there
while he interrogates me?

606
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:27,039
Looks like it. They
wanna know too.

607
01:02:28,665 --> 01:02:30,792
Further denials will
only waste time.

608
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:36,465
Confess and I'll release you.
I promise.

609
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:51,688
Ok, I work for them, but
they didn't put me in here!

610
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:55,317
I heard about the job internally
and applied like everyone else!

611
01:02:55,484 --> 01:02:58,153
Not everyone.

612
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,910
Tell us what we want to know.

613
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:08,997
I can't tell you anything
because I don't know anything!

614
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:13,210
HR doesn't cover the CEO's office,
he hires his staff personally!

615
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:18,173
I'm not lying! I wanna step
up as badly as you do!

616
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,011
Like I said, trust is a
devalued currency in here.

617
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:26,890
What proof can I
possibly give you?

618
01:03:48,662 --> 01:03:51,582
You know, it's funny...

619
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:55,169
how something so
simple and inoffensive

620
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,796
as a piece of paper,

621
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:01,925
when placed in the wrong hands

622
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:04,720
can become a deadly weapon.

623
01:04:06,597 --> 01:04:09,766
All from one slice of a tree.

624
01:04:13,145 --> 01:04:16,565
- What are you doing?
- What has to be done.

625
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:19,359
You're gonna torture me?

626
01:04:19,526 --> 01:04:22,988
- Do something! Please!
- Brown, what are you doing?

627
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:26,492
- I know what I'm doing.
- You've done this before?

628
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:29,495
- In the services.
- I thought you were a gambler.

629
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:31,872
All soldiers are gamblers.

630
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:37,085
See, I find the flesh of the inner
thigh especially sensitive.

631
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:42,049
- Fuck you! Get off me! - Stop this!
- This can't be our only option!

632
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:46,136
No, it isn't, it's mine.

633
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:52,017
What have we here?

634
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:57,564
Seems you got there before me.

635
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:02,110
What, undervalued at
work and at home?

636
01:05:03,737 --> 01:05:05,823
Daddy didn't love you, hm?

637
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:09,159
You studied psychology to find
out why? Tell me I'm wrong.

638
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:13,497
On second thoughts, don't
answer that. Answer this...

639
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:18,043
- What is the question?
- I don't know!

640
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,379
- You're lying!
- I don't know, I swear!

641
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:23,131
What is the question?

642
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:25,384
What is the purpose
of this exam?

643
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:29,763
Would I volunteer if the only way for you
to solve this was to beat it out of me?

644
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,015
How fucked up are you?

645
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:37,229
With 20 minutes left,
this fucked up.

646
01:05:37,396 --> 01:05:39,273
Ok, enough!

647
01:05:43,652 --> 01:05:46,738
Don't interfere.

648
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:54,913
For God's sake. This is a woman.

649
01:05:59,543 --> 01:06:02,004
Equal opportunities, Black.

650
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,340
HR wouldn't expect
anything less, would they?

651
01:06:07,259 --> 01:06:09,970
Oh, by all means,
ask him for help.

652
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:11,763
Look, it's nothing personal.

653
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:15,476
We just need to
know what you know.

654
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:20,856
Brown, don't do this! There
must be another way!

655
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:23,066
We need certainty.

656
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:26,820
The kind only unbearable
pain can give...

657
01:06:30,782 --> 01:06:33,452
I've told you everything I know!

658
01:06:33,619 --> 01:06:36,288
Please stop!

659
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,377
...or the threat of it.

660
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:48,217
She's telling the truth.

661
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:58,101
Sorry.

662
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:14,076
Here.

663
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:17,955
Thank you.

664
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:11,550
- You wanted convulsions.
- Now you've got them.

665
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:22,019
You think he's faking it.

666
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,897
It's genuine.

667
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:31,278
- How do you know?
- My wife, she died from it.

668
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:37,075
I'm a carrier. He's not faking.

669
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:41,705
Even liars tell the
truth occasionally.

670
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:47,544
- He really needs that
pill, doesn't he? - Fast.

671
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:52,841
If anyone took it, own up now.

672
01:08:58,597 --> 01:09:03,560
All right, if we can't trust each
other, we'll have to search each other.

673
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:45,602
Nothing.

674
01:09:56,655 --> 01:10:00,659
- Got any gum?
- Sorry. I'm all out.

675
01:10:03,245 --> 01:10:06,498
Really?

676
01:10:15,632 --> 01:10:19,511
All soldiers are gamblers

677
01:10:19,678 --> 01:10:22,347
and all gamblers are
cheats, I've found.

678
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:25,684
Given the opportunity.

679
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,854
- I took a calculated risk.
- You're as bad as he is.

680
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:32,191
No, he's worse. There was never
any pretence about White.

681
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:37,112
- Let's think about it selfishly
again. - While he's dying?

682
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:39,239
That's not selfishness,
that's murder!

683
01:10:39,406 --> 01:10:42,993
Coma comes before death, right?
People recover from comas.

684
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,787
Not this kind. Sink too
deep and it's irreversible.

685
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:49,124
But that pill mimics an
adrenaline shot to the heart.

686
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:53,462
- If you're gonna do it, do it now. -
Forgotten what you said about him?

687
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:56,131
We're not releasing him
We're saving his life!

688
01:10:56,298 --> 01:10:59,510
I'm afraid I can't do that!

689
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,730
I can see it, but I can't reach!

690
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:14,149
Let me try!

691
01:11:21,782 --> 01:11:24,451
Obviously the Gods agree
with my risk assessment.

692
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:36,004
Is he unconscious?

693
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:39,633
He's lapsing!

694
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,844
We have to carry him
out for treatment.

695
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:46,223
Biorg will understand. Trust me.

696
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:49,101
Are you gonna help me?

697
01:11:52,563 --> 01:11:55,774
Fine, you can live with his death
on your consciences. I can't.

698
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:09,663
He's bleeding! What
does that mean?

699
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:13,542
I don't know: I haven't seen this
before. But it can't be good.

700
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:28,682
- Do something, Black!
- Like what? I'm not a doctor!

701
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:31,560
Help him, please!

702
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,438
Can't you see he's dying?

703
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:42,321
No! I work for you! I work here!

704
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:19,233
You weren't wrong
about that pill.

705
01:13:25,656 --> 01:13:27,407
Hey...

706
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:31,119
- If you can hear me,
nod your... - Fuckers.

707
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,676
I have it too, brother.

708
01:13:45,843 --> 01:13:49,638
Yeah, well, don't
expect me to thank you.

709
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:53,600
You have her to thank...

710
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,269
...not me.

711
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,736
Well, I would've preferred
the kiss of life.

712
01:14:04,903 --> 01:14:08,407
I bet you're good at that.

713
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:15,205
Wow.

714
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:17,958
Four down and four to go.

715
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:21,879
And only 10 minutes
on the clock.

716
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:27,634
Exciting

717
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:36,143
I felt you take it, you know.

718
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:39,897
Room not big enough
for both of us?

719
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,408
That's the spirit, Brown.

720
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:03,545
If you remember me taking it,

721
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:07,799
you'll remember the
promise you made us.

722
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,135
Blonde gave you the
pill as requested.

723
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:13,430
Now give us what we
asked for in return.

724
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,851
- The question?
- What is it?

725
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:21,480
Where is it?

726
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:24,817
You still don't get it, do you?

727
01:15:28,362 --> 01:15:31,490
Let me spell this out for you.

728
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:38,288
There is no question!

729
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:43,710
All right?

730
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,172
There never was one!

731
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:50,259
Not the kind you're
looking for anyway.

732
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:53,554
That's what you've
been holding back?

733
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:57,516
- That's your big secret?
- Uh-huh.

734
01:15:57,683 --> 01:15:59,560
You heard the invigilator.

735
01:15:59,726 --> 01:16:03,272
There's one question before you,
and one answer is required.

736
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:05,691
There is one question!
You're calling him a liar?

737
01:16:05,858 --> 01:16:11,655
When you've eliminated the impossible,
whatever's left has to be the truth.

738
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:15,993
No matter how crazy it seems.

739
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,416
This test is the question!

740
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,253
And the answer is us.

741
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:32,676
- We're the answers.
- Answers, plural?

742
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:35,888
- If I recall...
- One answer is required.

743
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:39,391
- Singular.
- That's right.

744
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:44,354
Just one of us.

745
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:52,946
You wouldn't dare.

746
01:16:59,786 --> 01:17:01,246
Whoa! Whoa!

747
01:17:02,664 --> 01:17:06,585
- Whoa! Everybody calm down.
- Seconded.

748
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:10,297
All right, all right, all right.

749
01:17:14,802 --> 01:17:18,889
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- I didn't take it to shoot you!

750
01:17:19,056 --> 01:17:22,643
I took it to stop you
from using it on us!

751
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,397
Let me tell you what I think.

752
01:17:28,398 --> 01:17:33,070
I think we're the answers too.
All of us together, as a team!

753
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:35,531
I think we'd all passed
when we walked in.

754
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:38,534
All each of us can do is
lose what we've already won

755
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,286
through selfishness,
stupidity and impatience!

756
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,043
Deaf was right.

757
01:17:48,210 --> 01:17:51,338
We see what we want
to see in here.

758
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:53,841
You're a fighter so you
all can think about

759
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:55,676
is being the last man standing,

760
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:59,513
but they never said there was
only one position available.

761
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:01,932
Yeah, I see what I
want to see, Black.

762
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,104
And you hear what
you want to hear.

763
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:09,565
But answer me this, brother

764
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:14,820
What corporation doesn't know how
many positions it's got available?

765
01:18:14,987 --> 01:18:20,367
What CEO can't decide whether he
wants one assistant or eight?

766
01:18:23,829 --> 01:18:27,708
There's only one job going in
his office, you know that?

767
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,961
And the rest is fantasy.

768
01:18:36,842 --> 01:18:39,344
White, stay back!

769
01:18:39,511 --> 01:18:41,763
This ain't worth killing for.

770
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:44,558
You seem to think it is.
Is it...

771
01:18:46,643 --> 01:18:50,647
- ..worth dying for?
- Put the gun down, Black.

772
01:18:52,608 --> 01:18:54,526
You started this,
now it's in play!

773
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:57,529
- We can't put it back.
- Throw it out the door.

774
01:18:57,696 --> 01:19:00,699
That won't break any rules.

775
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:06,663
Go on, then, shoot me.

776
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:10,667
Go on, shoot me in
the head, go on.

777
01:19:15,297 --> 01:19:18,675
- See? You can't fight
who you are. - Don't!

778
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,933
Fingerprint ID.

779
01:20:11,562 --> 01:20:14,314
No!

780
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:19,444
OK.

781
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:25,659
OK, OK.

782
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:29,788
Just tell us what you want.

783
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:33,667
I want to be alone!

784
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:37,004
You want us to spoil our papers?

785
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,715
Disqualify ourselves?

786
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:43,218
OK.

787
01:20:44,303 --> 01:20:47,598
We'll take those odds
over the alternative.

788
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:52,811
You win.

789
01:20:59,193 --> 01:21:03,197
I can't let my partner escort you
out, we just became friends.

790
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:11,788
How about you walk out instead?

791
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:15,000
Each of you. One by one.

792
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:19,588
Starting with you.

793
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,801
Come on, we ain't got all day!
Let's go.

794
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:39,483
They deserve you.

795
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:46,698
Now you.

796
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,999
Come on.

797
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:01,964
- Don't be stupid, Black.
- You won't shoot.

798
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,759
I'll be missed.

799
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:09,513
You're sick like me.

800
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:13,809
Your death will be
explained away, Ok?

801
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:17,479
No one outside this
room even cares.

802
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:22,192
They've got problems of their own, like
avoiding the infection themselves.

803
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:26,488
Your conscience will haunt you.

804
01:22:28,282 --> 01:22:30,742
You're assuming I've got one.

805
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:37,040
I'll go. I'm through with this.

806
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,183
Don't cry, darlin'.

807
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:58,020
You were a passenger
in here, anyway.

808
01:22:58,187 --> 01:23:02,107
- You fucked your way to the
top. - Then I saved your life.

809
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:07,404
Well, anyone can make a mistake.

810
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,246
Lights out!

811
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,837
Lights on!

812
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,687
Toujours y voir clairement
est primordial.

813
01:25:03,854 --> 01:25:05,939
To see clearly is all.

814
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,874
Well?

815
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:30,672
You said there's one answer
and you're looking at him!

816
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:35,719
I've done everything! I made
everything happen in here,

817
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:37,971
and she's done nothing!

818
01:25:38,972 --> 01:25:41,809
It's me! I'm the one you want!

819
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,269
I'M THE ONE YOU WANT!

820
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:28,480
If you try to communicate
with myself or the guard...

821
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:32,651
...you will be disqualified.

822
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:45,664
That's it, join in at last.

823
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:48,584
You're deaf but not dumb, eh?

824
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:24,323
There is one question before
you, and one answer is required.

825
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:11,620
- Answers? - That's what
you've been holding back?

826
01:30:11,787 --> 01:30:16,542
- That's your big secret? - You
still don't get it, do you?

827
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:18,752
What is it? Where is it?

828
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:21,630
- The question? - What's
the purpose of this exam?

829
01:30:21,797 --> 01:30:26,301
- The question? What is it?
- Tell us! - What does it matter?

830
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:29,429
You really think
he's behind there?

831
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:32,432
He's lived behind walls for years.

832
01:30:32,599 --> 01:30:34,768
How do you know all this?

833
01:30:34,935 --> 01:30:38,856
Are you saying that they rigged the
test to bring us all together?

834
01:30:40,315 --> 01:30:42,401
Is there something
you want to tell us?

835
01:30:42,568 --> 01:30:45,529
- it's a piece of paper.
- It's more than that.

836
01:30:45,696 --> 01:30:48,365
If we can't see it, how are
we supposed to find it?

837
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:52,286
What if the question
is written down? We just can't see it?

838
01:30:52,452 --> 01:30:54,913
What if it reveals
the question too?

839
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:57,499
They're not gonna
make it that easy.

840
01:30:57,666 --> 01:31:00,294
How hard
can they afford to make it?

841
01:31:02,004 --> 01:31:04,548
So has anyone
figured out the answer yet?

842
01:31:04,715 --> 01:31:08,760
it's not about the answer,
it's about the question.

843
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:12,222
What is the question?

844
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:29,573
What is the question?

845
01:31:45,881 --> 01:31:48,967
Any questions?

846
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,139
No.

847
01:31:55,641 --> 01:32:00,479
That's the answer you wanted to
the first question asked of us.

848
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:03,106
The only question asked of you.

849
01:32:05,442 --> 01:32:08,862
- I almost missed it too.
- Almost.

850
01:32:09,029 --> 01:32:11,990
As it is, we're happy to
be hiring someone today.

851
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:15,077
I haven't accepted yet.

852
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:18,539
You wouldn't have participated
if you didn't want the job.

853
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:22,292
That was before.
Before all this.

854
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,506
Now it's over, I have questions.

855
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:31,218
- Questions?
- More than one.

856
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:39,351
Ask.

857
01:32:41,728 --> 01:32:44,606
You don't look like him.

858
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:52,072
Any suit can play the CEO for
shareholders and the media.

859
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:56,660
Our founder isn't a businessman.

860
01:32:56,827 --> 01:33:00,455
- He has no interest in fame.
- Too bad.

861
01:33:00,622 --> 01:33:04,293
- That was some performance.
- Who said it was a performance?

862
01:33:06,378 --> 01:33:10,424
Our founder is a
scientist, an innovator.

863
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:14,636
He's very particular about those
he invites to work with him,

864
01:33:14,803 --> 01:33:18,765
especially when it comes to the most
important hiring decision he's ever made.

865
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:22,227
Important enough to kill for?

866
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:29,610
What makes you think he's dead?

867
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,368
While searching for the cure,

868
01:34:19,535 --> 01:34:23,205
we stumbled upon something
far more powerful.

869
01:34:28,836 --> 01:34:32,005
Rapid cell regeneration...

870
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:38,804
...in a pill.

871
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:45,394
It eradicates the virus and
other stubborn mutations.

872
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:50,566
- The magic bullet.
- The gift of life for millions.

873
01:34:55,362 --> 01:35:02,244
Such a breakthrough creates
unanticipated dilemmas.

874
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:07,040
Too great for any
one man to bear.

875
01:35:11,503 --> 01:35:14,965
People are gonna
need this product,

876
01:35:15,132 --> 01:35:18,552
and we can only make
so much at a time.

877
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,347
Tough decisions are gonna have to
be made by a wise administrator,

878
01:35:22,514 --> 01:35:26,643
someone who combines a
listening disposition

879
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:30,314
with attention to detail

880
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:34,485
and compassion for
her fellow man.

881
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:41,909
If you are still interested...

882
01:36:34,586 --> 01:36:37,089
Il est revenu.

883
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:45,806
He is...

884
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:50,894
...risen.
